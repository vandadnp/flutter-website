title: Codelabs & workshops
description: "Codelabs and workshops help you quickly get started programming Flutter."
---

The Flutter codelabs provide a guided,
hands-on coding experience. Some codelabs
run in DartPad&mdash;no downloads required!

Flutter workshops are similar to the codelabs,
but are instructor led and always use DartPad.
The provided workshop link takes you to the relevant YouTube video,
which tells you where to find the associated DartPad link.

  You might want to check out the workshops
  created by our Google Developer Experts (GDEs).
  You can find them on the [Flutter community blog][].

## Good for beginners

If you're new to Flutter, we recommend starting with
one of these codelabs:

* [Building your first Flutter app][] (workshop)<br>
  An instructor-led version of our very popular
  "Write your first Flutter app, part 1" codelab
  (listed below).

* [Write your first Flutter app, part 1][]<br>
  Create a simple mobile app that generates proposed names
  for a startup company. In part one, you'll use a package
  that returns pairs of words at random and inserts them into
  an infinite scrolling list. You can also find this
  [codelab on docs.flutter.dev][].

* [Write your first Flutter app, part 2][]<br>
  Create a simple mobile app that generates proposed names
  for a startup company. In part two, you'll extend the
  example from part 1 to allow the user to select favorite
  word pairs, and add a second "Saved Favorites"
  page where users can view the selected names.
  Finally, you'll change the app's theme color.

* [Write your first Flutter app on the web][]<br>
  Implement a simple web app in DartPad (no downloads
  required!) that displays a sign-in screen
  containing three text fields. As the user fills out the
  fields, a progress bar animates along the top of the
  sign-in area. This codelab is written specifically for
  the web, but if you have downloaded and configured
  Android and iOS tooling, the completed app
  works on Android and iOS devices, as well.

## Next steps

* [Building scrolling experiences in Flutter][] (workshop)<br>
  Start with an app that performs simple, straightforward scrolling
  and enhance it to create fancy and custom scrolling effects
  by using slivers.

* [Dart null safety in Action][] (workshop)<br>
  An instructor-led workshop based on the [Null safety codelab][]
  on the dart.dev site.

* [How to manage application states using inherited widgets][inherited-widget-ws] (workshop)<br>
  Learn how to manage the state of your app's data by
  using the `InheritedWidget` class, one of the
  [low-level state management][] classes provided
  by Flutter.
