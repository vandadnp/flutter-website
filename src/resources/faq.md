### What is Flutter?

Flutter is Google's portable UI toolkit for crafting beautiful,
natively compiled applications for mobile, web,
and desktop from a single codebase.
Flutter works with existing code,
is used by developers and organizations around
the world, and is free and open source.

### Who is Flutter for?

For users, Flutter makes beautiful apps come to life.

For developers, Flutter lowers the bar to entry for building apps.
It speeds app development and reduces the cost and complexity
of app production across platforms.

For designers, Flutter provides a canvas for
high-end user experiences. Fast Company described
Flutter as [one of the top design ideas of the decade][] for
its ability to turn concepts into production code
without the compromises imposed by typical frameworks.
It also acts as a productive prototyping tool,
with [CodePen][] support for sharing your ideas with others.

For engineering managers and businesses,
Flutter allows the unification of app
developers into a single _mobile, web,
and desktop app team_, building branded
apps for multiple platforms out of a single codebase.
Flutter speeds feature development and synchronizes
release schedules across the entire customer base.

### How much development experience do I need to use Flutter?

Flutter is approachable to programmers familiar with
object-oriented concepts (classes, methods, variables,
etc) and imperative programming concepts (loops,
conditionals, etc).

We have seen people with very little programming
experience learn and use Flutter for prototyping
and app development.

### What kinds of apps can I build with Flutter?

Flutter is designed to support mobile apps that run
on both Android and iOS, as well as interactive apps
that you want to run on your web pages or on the desktop.

Apps that need to deliver highly branded designs
are particularly well suited for Flutter.
However, you can also create pixel-perfect experiences
that match the Android and iOS design languages with Flutter.

Flutter's [package ecosystem][] supports a wide
variety of hardware (such as camera, GPS, network,
and storage) and services (such as payments, cloud
storage, authentication, and [ads][]).

### Who makes Flutter?

Flutter is an open source project,
with contributions from Google and other
companies and individuals.

### Who uses Flutter?

Developers inside and outside of Google use
Flutter to build beautiful natively-compiled
apps for iOS and Android. To learn about some
of these apps, visit the [showcase][].

### What makes Flutter unique?

Flutter is different than most other options
for building mobile apps because it doesn't rely
on web browser technology nor the set of widgets
that ship with each device. Instead, Flutter uses
its own high-performance rendering engine to draw widgets.

In addition, Flutter is different because it only
has a thin layer of C/C++ code. Flutter implements
most of its system (compositing, gestures, animation,
framework, widgets, etc) in [Dart][] (a modern,
concise, object-oriented language) that developers
can easily approach read, change, replace, or remove.
This gives developers tremendous control over the system,
as well as significantly lowers the bar to approachability
for the majority of the system.

### Should I build my next production app with Flutter?

[Flutter 1.0][] was launched on Dec 4th, 2018 and
[Flutter 2][] on March 3rd, 2021.
Since its launch, over 400,000 apps have shipped using
Flutter to many hundreds of millions of devices.
See some sample apps in the [showcase][].

Flutter ships updates on a roughly-quarterly
cadence that improve stability and performance
and address commonly-requested user features.

## What does Flutter provide?

### What is inside the Flutter SDK?

Flutter includes:

* Heavily optimized, mobile-first 2D rendering engine
  with excellent support for text
* Modern react-style framework
* Rich set of widgets implementing Material Design and iOS-style
* APIs for unit and integration tests
* Interop and plugin APIs to connect to the system and 3rd-party SDKs
* Headless test runner for running tests on Windows, Linux, and Mac
* [Dart DevTools][] for testing, debugging, and profiling your app
* Command-line tools for creating, building, testing, and
  compiling your apps

### Does Flutter work with any editors or IDEs?

We provide plugins for [Android Studio][],
[IntelliJ IDEA][], and [VS Code][]. See
[editor configuration][] for setup details,
and [Android Studio/IntelliJ][] and [VS Code][]
for tips on how to use the plugins.

Alternatively, you can use the `flutter` command
from a terminal, along with one
of the many editors that support [editing Dart][].

### Does Flutter come with a framework?

Yes! Flutter ships with a modern react-style framework.
Flutter's framework is designed to be layered and
customizable (and optional). Developers can choose to
use only parts of the framework, or even replace
upper layers of the framework entirely.

### Does Flutter come with widgets?

Yes! Flutter ships with a set of
[high-quality Material Design and Cupertino
(iOS-style) widgets][widgets], layouts, and themes.
Of course, these widgets are only a starting point.
Flutter is designed to make it easy to create your own
widgets, or customize the existing widgets.

### Does Flutter support Material Design?

Yes! The Flutter and Material teams collaborate closely,
and Material is fully supported. A number of examples
of this are shown in the [MDC-103 Flutter:
Material Theming][] codelab.

### Does Flutter come with a testing framework?

Yes, Flutter provides APIs for writing unit and
integration tests. Learn more about [testing with Flutter][].

We use our own testing capabilities to test our SDK,
and we measure our [test coverage][] on every commit.

### Does Flutter come with debugging tools?

Yes, Flutter comes with [Flutter DevTools][] (also
called Dart DevTools). For more information, see
[Debugging with Flutter][] and the [Flutter DevTools][] docs.

### Does Flutter come with a dependency injection framework?

We don't ship with an opinionated solution,
but there are a variety of packages that offer
dependency injection and service location, such as [injectable][],
[get_it][], [kiwi][], and [riverpod][].

## Technology

### What technology is Flutter built with?

Flutter is built with C, C++, Dart, and Skia
(a 2D rendering engine). See this [architecture diagram][]
for a better picture of the main components.
For a more detailed description of the layered architecture
of Flutter, read the [architectural overview].

### How does Flutter run my code on Android? {#run-android}

The engine's C and C++ code are compiled with Android's NDK.
The Dart code (both the SDK's and yours)
are ahead-of-time (AOT) compiled into native, ARM, and x86
libraries. Those libraries are included in a "runner"
Android project, and the whole thing is built into an `.apk`.
When launched, the app loads the Flutter library.
Any rendering, input, or event handling, and so on,
is delegated to the compiled Flutter and app code.
This is similar to the way many game engines work.

During debug mode, Flutter uses a virtual machine (VM)
to run its code in order to enable stateful hot reload,
a feature that lets you make changes to your running code
without recompilation. You'll see a "debug" banner in
the top right-hand corner of your app when running in this mode,
to remind you that performance is not characteristic of
the finished release app.

### How does Flutter run my code on iOS? {#run-ios}

The engine's C and C++ code are compiled with LLVM.
The Dart code (both the SDK's and yours)
are ahead-of-time (AOT) compiled into a native, ARM library.
That library is included in a "runner" iOS project,
and the whole thing is built into an `.ipa`.
When launched, the app loads the Flutter library. Any rendering,
input or event handling, and so on,
are delegated to the compiled Flutter and app code.
This is similar to the way many game engines work.

During debug mode, Flutter uses a virtual machine (VM)
to run its code in order to enable stateful hot reload,
a feature that lets you make changes to your
running code without recompilation. You'll see
a "debug" banner in the top right-hand corner of
your app when running in this mode, to remind you that
performance is not characteristic of the finished release app.

### Does Flutter use my operating system's built-in platform widgets?

No. Instead, Flutter provides a set of widgets
(including Material Design and Cupertino (iOS-styled) widgets),
managed and rendered by Flutter's framework and engine.
You can browse a [catalog of Flutter's widgets][].

We believe that the end result is higher quality apps.
If we reused the built-in platform widgets,
the quality and performance of Flutter apps would be limited
by the flexibility and quality of those widgets.

In Android, for example, there's a hard-coded set
of gestures and fixed rules for disambiguating them.
In Flutter, you can write your own gesture recognizer
that is a first class participant in the [gesture system][].
Moreover, two widgets authored by different people can
coordinate to disambiguate gestures.

Modern app design trends point towards designers and
users wanting more motion-rich UIs and brand-first designs.
In order to achieve that level of customized, beautiful design,
Flutter is architectured to drive pixels instead
of the built-in widgets.

By using the same renderer, framework, and set of widgets,
it's easier to publish for multiple platforms from the same
codebase, without having to do careful and costly planning
to align different feature sets and API characteristics.

By using a single language, a single framework,
and a single set of libraries for all of your code
(regardless if your UI is different for each platform or not),
we also aim to help lower app development and maintenance costs.

### What happens when my mobile OS updates and introduces new widgets?

The Flutter team watches the adoption and demand for new mobile
widgets from iOS and Android, and aims to work with the community
to build support for new widgets. This work might come in the form
of lower-level framework features, new composable widgets, or new
widget implementations.

Flutter's layered architecture is designed to support numerous
widget libraries, and we encourage and support the community in
building and maintaining widget libraries.

### What happens when my mobile OS updates and introduces new platform capabilities?

Flutter's interop and plugin system is designed to allow
developers to access new mobile OS features and capabilities
immediately. Developers don't have to wait for the Flutter team
to expose the new mobile OS capability.

### What operating systems can I use to build a Flutter app?

Flutter supports development using Linux, macOS, ChromeOS,
and Windows.

### What language is Flutter written in?

[Dart][], a fast-growing modern language optimized
for client apps. The underlying graphics framework
and the Dart virtual machine are implemented in C/C++.

### Why did Flutter choose to use Dart?

During the initial development phase,
the Flutter team looked at a lot of
languages and runtimes, and ultimately
adopted Dart for the framework and widgets.
Flutter used four primary dimensions for evaluation,
and considered the needs of framework authors,
developers, and end users. We found many languages
met some requirements, but Dart scored highly on
all of our evaluation dimensions and met all our
requirements and criteria.

Dart runtimes and compilers support the combination of
two critical features for Flutter: a JIT-based fast
development cycle that allows for shape changing and
stateful hot reloads in a language with types,
plus an Ahead-of-Time compiler that emits efficient
ARM code for fast startup and predictable performance of
production deployments.

In addition, we have the opportunity to work closely
with the Dart community, which is actively investing
resources in improving Dart for use in Flutter. For
example, when we adopted Dart,
the language didn't have an ahead-of-time
toolchain for producing native binaries,
which is instrumental in achieving predictable,
high performance, but now the language does because the Dart team
built it for Flutter. Similarly, the Dart VM has
previously been optimized for throughput but the
team is now optimizing the VM for latency, which is more
important for Flutter’s workload.

Dart scores highly for us on the following primary criteria:

_Developer productivity_
: One of Flutter's main value propositions is that it
  saves engineering resources by letting developers
  create apps for both iOS and Android with the same codebase.
  Using a highly productive language accelerates
  developers further and makes Flutter more attractive.
  This was very important to both our framework team as
  well as our developers. The majority of Flutter
  is built in the same language we give to our users,
  so we need to stay productive at 100k's lines of code,
  without sacrificing approachability or
  readability of the framework and widgets for our developers.

_Object-orientation_
: For Flutter, we want a language that's suited to
  Flutter's problem domain: creating visual user experiences.
  The industry has multiple decades of experience building
  user interface frameworks in object-oriented languages.
  While we could use a non-object-oriented language,
  this would mean reinventing the wheel to solve several
  hard problems. Plus, the vast majority of developers
  have experience with object-oriented development,
  making it easier to learn how to develop with Flutter.

_Predictable, high performance_
: With Flutter, we want to empower developers to create fast,
  fluid user experiences. In order to achieve that, we need to
  be able to run a significant amount of end-developer code
  during every animation frame. That means we need a language
  that both delivers high performance and predictable
  performance, without periodic pauses that would cause
  dropped frames.

_Fast allocation_
: The Flutter framework uses a functional-style flow that
  depends heavily on the underlying memory allocator
  efficiently handling small, short-lived allocations.
  This style was developed in languages with this
  property and doesn't work efficiently in languages
  that lack this facility.

### Can Flutter run any Dart code?

Flutter can run Dart code that doesn't directly or
transitively import `dart:mirrors` or `dart:html`.

### How big is the Flutter engine?

In March 2021, we measured the download size of a
[minimal Flutter app][] (no Material Components,
just a single `Center` widget, built with `flutter build
apk --split-per-abi`), bundled and compressed as a release APK,
to be approximately 4.3 MB for ARM32, and 4.8 MB for ARM64.

On ARM32, the core engine is approximately 3.4 MB
(compressed), the framework + app code is approximately
765 KB (compressed), the LICENSE file is 58 KB
(compressed), and necessary Java code (`classes.dex`)
is 120 KB (compressed).

In ARM64, the core engine is approximately 4.0 MB 
(compressed), the framework + app code is approximately
659 KB (compressed), the LICENSE file is 58 KB
(compressed), and necessary Java code (`classes.dex`)
is 120 KB (compressed).

These numbers were measured using [apkanalyzer][],
which is also [built into Android Studio][].

On iOS, a release IPA of the same app has a download
size of 10.9 MB on an iPhone X, as reported by Apple’s
App Store Connect. The IPA is larger than the APK mainly
because Apple encrypts binaries within the IPA, making the
compression less efficient (see the
[iOS App Store Specific Considerations][]
section of Apple’s [QA1795][]).

The release engine binary includes LLVM IR (bitcode).
Xcode uses this bitcode to produce a final binary for
the App Store containing the latest compiler
optimizations and features. The profile and debug
frameworks contain only a _bitcode marker_, and are
more representative of the engine's actual binary size.
Whether you ship with bitcode or not,
the increased size of the release framework is
stripped out during the final steps of the build.
These steps happen after archiving your app and
shipping it to the store. Note bitcode has been deprecated
and will be removed from Flutter in a future release.

Of course, we recommend that you measure your own app.
To do that, see [Measuring your app's size][].

## Capabilities

### What kind of app performance can I expect?

You can expect excellent performance. Flutter is
designed to help developers easily achieve a constant 60fps.
Flutter apps run via natively compiled code&mdash;no
interpreters are involved.
This means that Flutter apps start quickly.

### What kind of developer cycles can I expect? How long between edit and refresh? {#hot-reload}

Flutter implements a _hot reload_ developer cycle. You can expect
sub-second reload times, on a device or an emulator/simulator.

Flutter's hot reload is _stateful_, which means the app state
is retained after a reload. This means you can quickly iterate
on a screen deeply nested in your app, without starting
from the home screen after every reload.

### How is _hot reload_ different from _hot restart_?

Hot reload works by injecting updated source code files
into the running Dart VM (Virtual Machine). This doesn't
only add new classes, but also adds methods and fields
to existing classes, and changes existing functions.
Hot restart resets the state to the app's initial state.

For more information, see [Hot reload][].

### Where can I deploy my Flutter app?

You can compile and deploy your Flutter app to iOS, Android,
[web][], and [desktop][].

### What devices and OS versions does Flutter run on?

* We support and test running Flutter on a variety
  of low-end to high-end platforms.  For a detailed list
  of the platforms on which we test, see 
  the list of [supported platforms][].

* Flutter supports building ahead-of-time (AOT) compiled libraries
  for `x86_64`, `armeabi-v7a`, and `arm64-v8a`.

* Apps built for ARMv7 or ARM64 run fine (using ARM emulation)
  on many x86 Android devices.

* We support developing Flutter apps on a range of platforms.
  See the system requirements listed under each
  [development operating system][install].

### Does Flutter run on the web?

Yes, web support is available in the stable channel.
You can compile existing Flutter code to work on the web.
For more details, check out the [web instructions][].

### Can I use Flutter to build desktop apps?

Yes, desktop support is in stable for Windows,
macOS, and Linux.

### Can I use Flutter inside of my existing native app?

Yes, learn more in the [add-to-app][] section of our website.
Also, note that experimental support for adding
[multiple Flutter screens or views][] is available.

### Can I access platform services and APIs like sensors and local storage?

Yes. Flutter gives developers out-of-the-box access to _some_
platform-specific services and APIs from the operating system.
However, we want to avoid the "lowest common denominator" problem
with most cross-platform APIs, so we don't intend to build
cross-platform APIs for all native services and APIs.

A number of platform services and APIs have
[ready-made packages][] available on pub.dev.
Using an existing package [is easy][].

Finally, we encourage developers to use Flutter's
asynchronous message passing system to create your
own integrations with [platform and third-party APIs][].
Developers can expose as much or as little of the
platform APIs as they need, and build layers of
abstractions that are a best fit for their project.

### Can I extend and customize the bundled widgets?

Absolutely. Flutter's widget system was designed
to be easily customizable.

Rather than having each widget provide a large number of parameters,
Flutter embraces composition. Widgets are built out of smaller
widgets that you can reuse and combine in novel ways to make
custom widgets. For example, rather than subclassing a generic
button widget, `ElevatedButton` combines a Material widget with a
`GestureDetector` widget. The Material widget provides the visual
design and the `GestureDetector` widget provides the
interaction design.

To create a button with a custom visual design, you can combine
widgets that implement your visual design with a `GestureDetector`,
which provides the interaction design. For example,
`CupertinoButton` follows this approach and combines a
`GestureDetector` with several other widgets that implement its
visual design.

Composition gives you maximum control over the visual and
interaction design of your widgets while also allowing a
large amount of code reuse. In the framework, we've decomposed
complex widgets to pieces that separately implement
the visual, interaction, and motion design. You can remix
these widgets however you like to make your own custom
widgets that have full range of expression.

### Why would I want to share layout code across iOS and Android?

You can choose to implement different app layouts for
iOS and Android. Developers are free to check the mobile OS
at runtime and render different layouts,
though we find this practice to be rare.

More and more, we see mobile app layouts and designs evolving
to be more brand-driven and unified across platforms.
This implies a strong motivation to share layout and UI
code across iOS and Android.

The brand identity and customization of the app's
aesthetic design is now becoming more important than
strictly adhering to traditional platform aesthetics.
For example, app designs often require custom fonts, colors,
shapes, motion, and more in order to clearly convey their
brand identity.

We also see common layout patterns deployed across
iOS and Android. For example, the "bottom nav bar"
pattern can now be naturally found across iOS and Android.
There seems to be a convergence of design ideas
across mobile platforms.

### Can I interop with my mobile platform's default programming language?

Yes, Flutter supports calling into the platform,
including integrating with Java or Kotlin code on Android,
and ObjectiveC or Swift code on iOS.
This is enabled via a flexible message passing style
where a Flutter app might send and receive messages
to the mobile platform using a [`BasicMessageChannel`][].

Learn more about accessing platform and third-party services
in Flutter with [platform channels][].

Here is an [example project][] that shows how to use a
platform channel to access battery state information on
iOS and Android.

### Does Flutter come with a reflection / mirrors system?

No. Dart includes `dart:mirrors`,
which provides type reflection. But since
Flutter apps are pre-compiled for production,
and binary size is always a concern with mobile apps,
this library is unavailable for Flutter apps.

Using static analysis we can strip out anything that isn't
used ("tree shaking"). If you import a huge Dart library
but only use a self-contained two-line method,
then you only pay the cost of the two-line method,
even if that Dart library itself imports dozens and
dozens of other libraries. This guarantee is only secure
if Dart can identify the code path at compile time.
To date, we've found other approaches for specific needs
that offer a better trade-off, such as code generation.

### How do I do international&shy;ization (i18n), localization (l10n), and accessibility (a11y) in Flutter?

Learn more about i18n and l10n in the
[internationalization tutorial][].

Learn more about a11y in the
[accessibility documentation][].

### How do I write parallel and/or concurrent apps for Flutter?

Flutter supports isolates. Isolates are separate heaps in
Flutter's VM, and they are able to run in parallel
(usually implemented as separate threads). Isolates
communicate by sending and receiving asynchronous messages.

Check out an [example of using isolates with Flutter][].

### Can I run Dart code in the background of an Flutter app?

Yes, you can run Dart code in a background process on both
iOS and Android  For more information, see the free Medium article
[Executing Dart in the Background with Flutter Plugins and Geofencing][].

### Can I use JSON/XML/<wbr>protobuffers, etc. with Flutter?

Absolutely. There are libraries on
[pub.dev][] for JSON, XML, protobufs,
and many other utilities and formats.

For a detailed writeup on using JSON with Flutter,
check out the [JSON tutorial][].

### Can I build 3D (OpenGL) apps with Flutter?

Today we don't support for 3D via OpenGL ES or similar.
We have long-term plans to expose an optimized 3D API,
but right now we're focused on 2D.

### Why is my APK or IPA so big?

Usually, assets including images, sound files, fonts, etc,
are the bulk of an APK or IPA. Various tools in the
Android and iOS ecosystems can help you understand
what's inside of your APK or IPA.

Also, be sure to create a _release build_
of your APK or IPA with the Flutter tools.
A release build is usually _much_ smaller
than a _debug build_.

Learn more about creating a
[release build of your Android app][],
and creating a [release build of your iOS app][].
Also, check out [Measuring your app's size][].

### Do Flutter apps run on Chromebooks?

We have seen Flutter apps run on some Chromebooks.
We are tracking [issues related to running Flutter on
Chromebooks][].

### Is Flutter ABI compatible?

Flutter and Dart do not offer application binary interface (ABI)
compatibility. Offering ABI compatability is not a current
goal for Flutter or Dart.

## Framework

### Why is the build() method on State, rather than StatefulWidget?

Putting a `Widget build(BuildContext context)` method on `State`
rather putting a `Widget build(BuildContext context, State state)`
method on `StatefulWidget` gives developers more flexibility when
subclassing `StatefulWidget`. You can read a more
[detailed discussion on the API docs for `State.build`][].

### Where is Flutter's markup language? Why doesn't Flutter have a markup syntax?

Flutter UIs are built with an imperative, object-oriented
language (Dart, the same language used to build Flutter's
framework). Flutter doesn't ship with a declarative markup.

We found that UIs dynamically built with code allow for
more flexibility. For example, we have found it difficult
for a rigid markup system to express and produce
customized widgets with bespoke behaviors.

We have also found that our "code-first" better allows
for features like hot reload and dynamic environment adaptations.

It's possible to create a custom language that is then
converted to widgets on the fly. Because build methods
are "just code", they can do anything,
including interpreting markup and turning it into widgets.

### My app has a Debug banner/ribbon in the upper right. Why am I seeing that?

By default `flutter run` command uses the debug build configuration.

The debug configuration runs your Dart code in a VM (Virtual Machine)
enabling a fast development cycle with [hot reload][]
(release builds are compiled using the standard [Android][]
and [iOS][] toolchains).

The debug configuration also checks all asserts, which helps
you catch errors early during development, but imposes a
runtime cost. The "Debug" banner indicates that these checks
are enabled. You can run your app without these checks by
using either the `--profile` or `--release` flag to `flutter run`.

If your IDE uses the Flutter plugin,
you can launch the app in profile or release mode.
For IntelliJ, use the menu entries
**Run > Flutter Run in Profile Mode** or **Release Mode**.

### What programming paradigm does Flutter's framework use?

Flutter is a multi-paradigm programming environment.
Many programming techniques developed over the past few decades
are used in Flutter. We use each one where we believe
the strengths of the technique make it particularly well-suited.
In no particular order:

**Composition**
: The primary paradigm used by Flutter is that of using
  small objects with narrow scopes of behavior, composed together to
  obtain more complicated effects, sometimes called
  _aggressive composition_. Most widgets in the Flutter widget
  library are built in this way. For example, the Material
  [`TextButton`][] class is built using
  an [`IconTheme`][], an [`InkWell`][], a [`Padding`][],
  a [`Center`][], a [`Material`][],
  an [`AnimatedDefaultTextStyle`][], and a [`ConstrainedBox`][].
  The [`InkWell`][] is built using a [`GestureDetector`][].
  The [`Material`][] is built using an
  [`AnimatedDefaultTextStyle`][],
  a [`NotificationListener`][], and an [`AnimatedPhysicalModel`][].
  And so on. It's widgets all the way down.

**Functional programming**
: Entire applications can be built with only
  [`StatelessWidget`][]s, which are essentially functions that
  describe how arguments map to other functions, bottoming out
  in primitives that compute layouts or paint graphics.
  (Such applications can't easily have state,
  so are typically non-interactive.) For example, the [`Icon`][]
  widget is essentially a function that maps its arguments
  ([`color`][], [`icon`][], [`size`][]) into layout primitives.
  Additionally, heavy use is made of immutable data structures,
  including the entire [`Widget`][] class
  hierarchy as well as numerous supporting classes such as
  [`Rect`][] and [`TextStyle`][]. On a smaller scale, Dart's
  [`Iterable`][] API, which makes heavy use of the functional
  style (map, reduce, where, etc), is frequently used to process
  lists of values in the framework.

**Event-driven programming**
: User interactions are represented by event objects
  that are dispatched to callbacks registered with event handlers.
  Screen updates are triggered by a similar callback mechanism. The
  [`Listenable`][] class, which is used as the basis of the
  animation system, formalizes a subscription model for events
  with multiple listeners.

**Class-based object-oriented programming**
: Most of the APIs of the framework are built using classes
  with inheritance. We use an approach whereby we define
  very high-level APIs in our base classes, then specialize
  them iteratively in subclasses. For example,
  our render objects have a base class ([`RenderObject`][])
  that is agnostic regarding the coordinate system,
  and then we have a subclass ([`RenderBox`][])
  that introduces the opinion that the geometry should be based
  on the Cartesian coordinate system (x/width and y/height).

**Prototype-based object-oriented programming**
: The [`ScrollPhysics`][] class chains instances to compose
  the physics that apply to scrolling dynamically at runtime.
  This lets the system compose, for example, paging physics
  with platform-specific physics, without the platform having to be
  selected at compile time.

**Imperative programming**
: Straightforward imperative programming, usually
  paired with state encapsulated within an object,
  is used where it provides the most intuitive solution.
  For example, tests are written in an imperative style,
  first describing the situation under test, then listing
  the invariants that the test must match, then advancing
  the clock or inserting events as necessary for the test.

**Reactive programming**
: The widget and element trees are sometimes described as
  reactive, because new inputs provided in a widget's
  constructor are immediately propagated as changes to
  lower-level widgets by the widget's build method, and
  changes made in the lower widgets (for example,
  in response to user input) propagate back up the tree
  via event handlers. Aspects of both functional-reactive and
  imperative-reactive are present in the framework,
  depending on the needs of the widgets. Widgets with build
  methods that consist of just an expression describing how
  the widget reacts to changes in its configuration are functional
  reactive widgets (for example, the Material [`Divider`][] class).
  Widgets whose build methods construct a list of children
  over several statements, describing how the widget reacts
  to changes in its configuration, are imperative reactive
  widgets (for example, the [`Chip`][] class).

**Declarative programming**
: The build methods of widgets are often a single
  expression with multiple levels of nested constructors,
  written using a strictly declarative subset of Dart.
  Such nested expressions could be mechanically transformed
  to or from any suitably expressive markup language.
  For example, the [`UserAccountsDrawerHeader`][]
  widget has a long build method (20+ lines),
  consisting of a single nested expression.
  This can also be combined with the imperative style to build UIs
  that would be harder to describe in a pure-declarative approach.

**Generic programming**
: Types can be used to help developers catch programming
  errors early. The Flutter framework uses generic programming to
  help in this regard. For example, the [`State`][]
  class is parameterized in terms of the type of its
  associated widget, so that the Dart analyzer can catch
  mismatches of states and widgets. Similarly, the
  [`GlobalKey`][] class takes a type parameter so that it
  can access a remote widget's state in a type-safe manner
  (using runtime checking), the [`Route`][] interface is
  parameterized with the type that it is expected to use when
  [popped][], and collections such as [`List`][]s, [`Map`][]s,
  and [`Set`][]s are all parameterized so that mismatched
  elements can be caught early either during analysis or at
  runtime during debugging.

**Concurrent programming**
: Flutter makes heavy use of [`Future`][]s and other
  asynchronous APIs. For example, the animation system reports
  when an animation is finished by completing a future.
  The image loading system similarly uses futures to report
  when a load is complete.

**Constraint programming**
: The layout system in Flutter uses a weak form of
  constraint programming to determine the geometry of a scene.
  Constraints (for example, for cartesian boxes, a minimum and
  maximum width and a minimum and maximum height)
  are passed from parent to child, and the child selects a resulting
  geometry (for example, for cartesian boxes, a size,
  specifically a width and a height) that fulfills those constraints.
  By using this technique, Flutter can usually
  lay out an entire scene with a single pass.

## Project

### Where can I get support?

If you think you've encountered a bug, file it in our
[issue tracker][]. You might also use
[Stack Overflow][] for "HOWTO" type questions.
For discussions, join our mailing list at
[{{site.email}}][] or seek us out on [Discord][].

For more information, see our [Community][] page.

### How do I get involved?

Flutter is open source, and we encourage you to contribute.
You can start by simply filing issues for feature requests
and bugs in our [issue tracker][].

We recommend that you join our mailing list at
[{{site.email}}][] and let us know how you're
using Flutter and what you'd like to do with it.

If you're interested in contributing code, you can start
by reading our [Contributing Guide][] and check out our
list of [easy starter issues][].

Finally, you can connect with helpful Flutter communities.
For more information, see our [Community][] page.

### Is Flutter open source?

Yes, Flutter is open source technology.
You can find the project on [GitHub][].

### Which software license(s) apply to Flutter and its dependencies?

Flutter includes two components: an engine that ships as a
dynamically linked binary, and the Dart framework as a separate
binary that the engine loads. The engine uses multiple software
components with many dependencies; view the complete list
in its [license file][].

The framework is entirely self-contained and requires
[only one license][].

In addition, any Dart packages you use might have their
own license requirements.

### How can I determine the licenses my Flutter application needs to show?

There's an API to find the list of licenses you need to show:

* If your application has a [`Drawer`][], add an
  [`AboutListTile`][].

* If your application doesn't have a Drawer but does use the
  Material Components library, call either [`showAboutDialog`][]
  or [`showLicensePage`][].

* For a more custom approach, you can get the raw licenses from the
  [`LicenseRegistry`][].

### Who works on Flutter?

We all do! Flutter is an open source project.
Currently, the bulk of the development is done
by engineers at Google. If you're excited about Flutter,
we encourage you to join the community and
[contribute to Flutter][]!

### What are Flutter's guiding principles?

We believe the following:

* In order to reach every potential user,
  developers need to target multiple mobile platforms.
* HTML and WebViews as they exist today make it challenging to
  consistently hit high frame rates and deliver
  high-fidelity experiences, due to automatic behavior (scrolling,
  layout) and legacy support.
* Today, it's too costly to build the same app multiple times: it
  requires different teams, different code bases,
  different workflows, different tools, etc.
* Developers want an easier, better way to use a single codebase to
  build mobile apps for multiple target platforms,
  and they don't want to sacrifice quality, control, or performance.

We are focused on three things:

_Control_
: Developers deserve access to, and control over,
  all layers of the system. Which leads to:

_Performance_
: Users deserve perfectly fluid, responsive,
  jank-free apps. Which leads to:

_Fidelity_:
: Everyone deserves precise, beautiful, delightful
  app experiences.

### Will Apple reject my Flutter app?

We can't speak for Apple, but their App Store contains
many apps built with framework technologies such as Flutter.
Indeed, Flutter uses the same fundamental architectural
model as Unity, the engine that powers many of the
most popular games on the Apple store.

Apple has frequently featured well-designed apps
that are built with Flutter,
including [Hamilton][Hamilton for iOS] and [Reflectly][].

As with any app submitted to the Apple store,
apps built with Flutter should follow Apple's
[guidelines][] for App Store submission.
